## InTaVia
- H2020 project
- 4 countries: Slovenia, Austria, The Netherlands and Finland
- started 2020-11-01
- less than 1 year to go

+++

## Goals
- integrate 4 national biographical dictionaries
- further enrich them (LOD & NLP)
- provide a online platform for Visual Analytics on top of the data

+++

## Research questions
- is it possible to integrate different prosopographical resources and create a almost homogenous resource?
- can we use NLP and/or the LOD to enrich the less rich data points?
- does VA provide useful means to analyse such a dataset?
